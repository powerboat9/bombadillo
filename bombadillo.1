\fBbombadillo \fP- a non-web browser
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbombadillo\fP is a non-web browser for the terminal. It features a full terminal user interface, vim-like keybindings, document pager, configurable settings, and a robust command selection.
.TP
\fBbombadillo\fP supports the following protocols as first class citizens: gopher, gemini, finger, and local (a userâ€™s file system). Support for telnet, http and https is also available via integration with third party applications.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP
Display usage help and exit. Provides a list of all command line options with a short description and exits.
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP
Set the window title to 'Bombadillo'. Can be used in a GUI environment, however not all terminals support this feature.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Display version information and exit.
.SH PROTOCOL SUPPORT
All of the below protocols are supported. With the exception of gopher, the protocol name must be present as the scheme component of a url in the form of \fI[protocol]://[the rest of the url]\fP.
.TP
.B
gopher
Gopher is the default protocol for \fBbombadillo\fP. Any textual item types will be visited and shown to the user and any non-text types will be downloaded. Type 7 (querying) is fully supported. As the default protocol, any url that is not prefixed with the scheme section of a url (\fIgopher://\fP for example) will be treated as gopher urls.
.TP
.B
gemini
Gemini is supported, but as a new protocol with an incomplete specification, features may change over time. At present Bombadillo supports TLS with a trust on first use certificate pinning system (similar to SSH). Gemini maps and other text types are rendered in the browser and non-text types will be downloaded.
.TP
.B
finger
Basic support is provided for the finger protocol. The format is: \fIfinger://[[username@]][hostname]\fP. Many servers still support finger and it can be fun to see if friends are online or read about the users whose phlogs you follow.
.TP
.B
local
Local is similar to the \fIfile\fP protocol used in web browsers or the like, with a smaller set of features. Users can use the local scheme to view files on their local system. Directories are supported as viewable text object as well as any files. Wildcards and globbing are not supported. Using \fI~\fP to represent a user's home directory, as well as relative paths, are supported. The \fIcolor\fP theme has no effect on this protocol and all terminal escape sequences will be rendered to the screen literally.
.TP
.B
telnet
Telnet is not supported directly, but addresses will be followed and opened as a subprocess by whatever telnet client a user sets in their settings (defaulting to \fItelnet\fP). In some cases this behavior may be buggy.
.TP
.B
http, https
Neither of the world wide web protocols are supported directly. \fBbombadillo\fP can be configured to open web links in a user's default graphical web browser. It is also possible to display web content directly in \fBbombadillo\fP using lynx, w3m, or elinks terminal web browsers to render pages. Opening http/https links is opt-in only, controlled by the \fIwebmode\fP setting.
.IP
Opening links in a default graphical web browser will only work in a GUI environment.
.IP
Displaying web content directly in \fBbombadillo\fP requires lynx, w3m or elinks terminal web browsers are installed on the system.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS  KEY COMMANDS

.SH FILES
\fBbombadillo\fP keeps a hidden configuration file in a user's XDG configuration directory. The file is a simplified ini file titled \fI.bombadillo.ini\fP. It is generated when a user first loads \fBbombadillo\fP and is updated with bookmarks and settings as a user adds them. The file can be directly edited, but it is best to use the SET command to update settings whenever possible. To return to the state of a fresh install, simply remove the file and a new one will be generated with the \fBbombadillo\fP defaults. On some systems an administrator may set the configuration file location to somewhere other than the default setting. If you do not see the file where you expect it, or if your settings are not being read, try \fI:check configlocation\fP to see where the file should be, or contact your system administrator for more information.
.SH SETTINGS
The following is a list of the settings that \fBbombadillo\fP recognizes, as well as a description of their valid values.
.TP
.B
configlocation
The path to the directory that the \fI.bombadillo.ini\fP configuration file is stored in. This is a \fBread only\fP setting and cannot be changed with the \fIset\fP command, but it can be read with the \fIcheck\fP command.
.TP
.B
defaultscheme
The scheme that should be used when no scheme is present in a given URL. \fIgopher\fP, \fIgemini\fP, \fIhttp\fP, and \fIhttps\fP are valid values.
.TP
.B
geminiblocks
Determines how to treat preformatted text blocks in text/gemini documents. \fIblock\fP will show the contents of the block, \fIalt\fP will show any available alt text for the block, \fIboth\fP will show both the content and the alt text, and \fIneither\fP will show neither. Unlike other settings, a change to this value will require a fresh page load to see the change.
.TP
.B
homeurl
The url that \fBbombadillo\fP navigates to when the program loads or when the \fIhome\fP or \fIh\fP LINE COMMAND is issued. This should be a valid url. If a scheme/protocol is not included, gopher will be assumed.
.TP
.B
savelocation
The path to the directory that \fBbombadillo\fP should write files to. This must be a valid filepath for the system, must be a directory, and must already exist.
.TP
.B
searchengine
The url to use for the LINE COMMANDs \fI?\fP and \fIsearch\fP. Should be a valid search path that terms may be appended to.
.TP
.B
telnetcommand
Tells the browser what command to use to start a telnet session. Should be a valid command, including any flags. The address being navigated to will be added to the end of the command.
.TP
.B
theme
Can toggle between visual modes. Valid values are \fInormal\fP, \fIcolor\fP, and \fIinverse\fP. When set to inverse, the normal mode colors are inverted. Both normal and inverse modes filter out terminal escape sequences. When set to color, Bombadillo will render terminal escape sequences representing colors when it finds them in documents.
.TP
.B
webmode
Controls behavior when following web links. The following values are valid: \fInone\fP will disable following web links, \fIgui\fP will have the browser attempt to open web links in a user's default graphical web browser; \fIlynx\fP, \fIw3m\fP, and \fIelinks\fP will have the browser attempt to use the selected terminal web browser to handle the rendering of web pages and will display the pages directly in Bombadillo.
