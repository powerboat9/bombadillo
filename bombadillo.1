\fBbombadillo \fP- a non-web client
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBbombadillo\fP [\fB-v\fP] [\fB-h\fP] [\fIurl\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbombadillo\fP is a terminal based client for a number of internet protocols. \fBbombadillo\fP will also connect links to a user's default web browser or telnet client. Commands input is loosely based on Vi and Less and is comprised of two modes: key and line input mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Display the version number of \fBbombadillo\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP
Usage help. Displays all command line options with a short description.
.SH PROTOCOL SUPPORT
All of the below protocols are supported. With the exception of gopher, the protocol name must be present as the scheme component of a url in the form of \fI[protocol]://[the rest of the url]\fP.
.TP
.B
gopher
Gopher is the default protocol for \fBbombadillo\fP. Any textual item types will be visited and shown to the user and any non-text types will be downloaded. Type 7 (querying) is fully supported. As the default protocol, any url that is not prefixed with the scheme section of a url (\fIgopher://\fP for example) will be treated as gopher urls.
.TP
.B
gemini
Gemini is supported, but as a new protocol with an incomplete specification, features may change over time. At present Bombadillo supports TLS with a trust on first use certificate pinning system (similar to SSH). Client certificates are also supported via option configuration. Gemini maps and other text types are rendered in the client and non-text types will trigger a prompt to the user to download or open in an appropriate program. 
.TP
.B
finger
Basic support is provided for the finger protocol. The format is: \fIfinger://[[username@]][hostname]\fP. Many servers still support finger and it can be fun to see if friends are online or read about the users who's phlogs you follow.
.TP
.B
local
Local is similar to the \fIfile\fP protocol user's may be used to in web browsers or the like. The only difference is that the feature set of local may be smaller than file. User's can use the local scheme to view files on their local system. Directories are supported as viewable text object as well as any files. Wildcards and globbing are not supported. Using \fI~\fP to represent a user's home directory, as well as relative paths, are supported.
.TP
.B
telnet
Telnet is not supported directly, but addresses will be followed and opened as a subprocess by whatever telnet client a user sets in their settings (defaulting to \fItelnet\fP). In some cases this behavior may be buggy.
.TP
.B
http, https
Neither of the world wide web protocols are supported directly. However, bombadillo is capable of attempting to open web links in a user's default web browser. This feature is opt-in only and controlled in a user's settings. This feature does not function properly in a terminal only environment at present.

.SH FILES
\fBbombadillo\fP keeps a hidden configuration file in a user's home directory. The file is a simplified ini file titled \fI.bombadillo.ini\fP. It is generated when a user first loads \fBbombadillo\fP and is updated with bookmarks and settings as a user adds them. The file can be directly edited, but it is best to use the SET command to update settings whenever possible. To return to the state of a fresh install, simply remove the file and a new one will be generated with the \fBbombadillo\fP defaults.
.SH SETTINGS
The following is a list of the settings that \fBbombadillo\fP recognizes, as well as a description of their valid values.

.TP
.B
openhttp
Tells the client whether or not to try to follow web (http/https) links. If set to \fItrue\fP, \fBbombadillo\fP will try to open a user's default web browser to the link in question. Any value other than \fItrue\fP is considered false. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP. Does not work in a terminal only environment.
