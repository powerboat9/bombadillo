Gemini Protocol
---------------------------

Gemini is a recent internet protocol. As Bombadillo 2.0 was being developed its design was really just getting started and Bombadillo was an early adopter and Bombadillo developers were involved in the discussions around the creation of the protocol.

Bombadillo's implementation of the gemini protocol is centered around document retrieval, rather than applications. As such, client certificates were tested out but are deprecated in the client. Due to the terminal nature of Bombadillo and a desire to be simple and reliable headings, lists, and blockquotes are rendered literally in text/gemini documents.
