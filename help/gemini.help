Gemini Protocol
---------------------------

Gemini is a recent internet protocol. As Bombadillo 2.0 was being developed its design was really just getting started and Bombadillo was an early adopter and Bombadillo developers were involved in the discussions around the creation of the protocol.

Bombadillo's implementation of the gemini protocol is centered around document retrieval, rather than applications. As such, client certificates were tested out but are deprecated in the client. Due to the terminal nature of Bombadillo and a desire to be simple and reliable headings, lists, and blockquotes are rendered literally in text/gemini documents.



-- Bombadillo Gemini Support --


Bombadillo supports:

- TLS for every connection to a gemini server
- A TOFU security model when interacting with servers
- Query fields (used for searching/interaction)
- Redirects
- Error messaging support (server errors, client errors, etc)
- Links for text/gemini documents
- Pre-formatted blocks for text/gemini documents (including alt text support)
- Support for relative links in text/gemini documents


Bombadillo does not support:

- Client certificates
- Special rendering for lists, headings, and blockquotes in text/gemini documents
   - Special rendering here refers to font changes or similar



-- TLS / TOFU --


Bombadillo connects to all gemini servers via TLS. During the TLS connection handshake the server provides a certificate. If this is the first time you have visited this particular host then Bombadillo will save the certificate hash and its expiration automatically and connect you to the site. The next time you visit a document at that same host the certificate offered by the server will be compared to the one on file. If the one on file has expired then the new one will be accepted automatically. If the certificates differ and the one on file has not expired then you will receive an error message from Bombadillo letting you know that "no matching cert was found". Bombadillo will not connect to the site. This is for your protection and is intentional. It makes you make a choice: trust this new certificate or not. Most users will likely decide to trust the new certificate. To have Bombadillo trust the new certificate you must purge the old one.

To purge a certificate for the host example.com run the following Bombadillo command:

`purge example.com`

Now when you visit the site again it will accept the new certificate and file it away as the one to compare against.

For more info on the purge command, see `help commands`

Other reasons you may receive an error related to certificates:

- The server offers a certificate that is expired
- The server offers a certificate that is not yet valid
- The server offers a certificate with a hostname different than the one you are requesting

If any of the above occur you will be notified. A purge will not solve this problem. Bombadillo, for your safety, will not connect to a site that does not offer a valid TLS certificate. This is by design and will most certainly annoy you when it happens. For that we appologize.
